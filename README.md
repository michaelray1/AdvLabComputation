# AdvLabComputation

This repository is populated with code used for my senior year advanced lab class. In particular, we were instructed to simulate the motion of a charged particle in various electromagnetic field configurations. In this repository you will find two files. The first, AdvLabComputation.py is a module containing functions which help to create paths of particles in various magnetic field configurations. So far, the code can only handle constant electromagnetic fields, magnetic dipole fields, or a combination of many magnetic dipoles. Electric fields are allowed within the code but have not been tested rigorously. The second file, compute_path.py is a file which when run, prompts the user to choose an electromagnetic configuration from a list of options, and then automatically computes the path of an alpha particle and a negative hydrogen ion in the field configuration specified. It also computes the field lines associated with any dipole fields. The field lines and paths are then saved to files in the working directory.
